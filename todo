Design
1. improve the style of priority 
    - change the shape of styling of project
    - I duplicate the style of button in form with .priority-btn class
    - make the colors respect all dark and light mode

2. I made a file of priority item to style and don't add anything to item       
    - what is the best case to handle this case

3. because I sperate the component, I need to sperate sytles for every component
---------------------------------------------
**- Logic -**
1. divide the code in component
2. ensure the code respect the concept of event
3. make a code more clean (new names I add)
    - in some project the name of priority is priorityClass and part is priority
4. what is the best way to make a editing with popup
5. add loading in custom hook (useEffect)
6. you can use TypeScript Enhancements:
    - use enum for all completed notCompleted or union
7. use Rect.memo in TodoItem and handle new referance of todo in every render
8. I think can use useRef in editing todo
9. study how can use useMemo and useCallback in new component (TodoList, EditTodoPopup)
    - it use useMemo in redner function but can use React.memo in all function
10. managing form inputs => using custom hook for it
-----------------------
clear all comments

==> editing todo **
==> useCallback and useMemo
==> split every compoent in file
===> why must pass addTodo form app to todoForm
